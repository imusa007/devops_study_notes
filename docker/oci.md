# Open Container Initiative (OCI)

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an industry standards organization that aims to standardize container technology. Founded in June 2015 by Docker, CoreOS, and other leaders in the container industry, the OCI is currently under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. The goal of OCI is to ensure interoperability between different container solutions by creating open standards.

The two main standards specified by OCI are:

1. **OCI Runtime Specification**: 
    - This specification defines the configuration, execution environment, and lifecycle of a container. Essentially, it describes how to run a container. 
    - The specification is platform agnostic, which means it is designed to support different operating systems and architectures. 
    - An implementation of the OCI Runtime Specification is called an OCI Runtime. Examples include `runc` (the most widely used implementation, initially developed by Docker), `crun`, and `railcar`. 
    - The configuration for a container is described in a `config.json` file. This configuration file includes various settings such as the root filesystem for the container, the command to run, environment variables, and resource limits (via cgroups).
    
2. **OCI Image Specification**: 
    - This specification outlines how to package a container and its associated metadata. In essence, it describes the format of a container image, which is a portable, self-sufficient package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
    - The Image Specification defines a set of layers, where each layer represents a set of file system changes. These layers are stacked on top of each other to produce the container's file system.
    - The Image Specification also includes a manifest, which is a JSON file that describes the contents and dependencies of the image. This manifest specifies the various layers that make up the image and other metadata.
    - OCI images are intended to be distributed through various means, including over the network via container registries (like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, and others).
    
By defining these two separate but complementary standards, the OCI aims to enable broad interoperability and compatibility between various container tools and platforms. Before OCI, different container technologies used different formats and standards, which could lead to lock-in and challenges in moving containers between different environments.

Here are some benefits of the OCI standards:

1. **Interoperability**: Because the standards are open and vendor-neutral, different tools and platforms that comply with OCI standards can work together. For example, a container image built by one tool should be runnable by any OCI-compliant runtime, regardless of who created that runtime.

2. **Portability**: With OCI standards, a container image can be run consistently across different environments. This is essential for the promise of "build once, run anywhere" that containers aim to provide.

3. **Innovation**: By standardizing the basic components of container technology, the OCI allows developers to focus on building new, innovative tools and platforms on top of a stable, standardized base.

4. **Avoiding Vendor Lock-in**: Since the OCI standards are open and neutral, they help to avoid the risk of vendor lock-in that can come with proprietary formats and interfaces.

These standards are developed openly on GitHub, and anyone can participate in their development by submitting issues and pull requests, or by joining the mailing lists and regular calls of the OCIâ€™s Technical Oversight Board (TOB).
